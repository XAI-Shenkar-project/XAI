# XAI
The significance of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has soared in today's landscape of intricate machine learning models. As AI systems become more sophisticated, their inner workings often appear opaque and challenging to decipher.

XAI addresses this challenge by imbuing artificial intelligence with the ability to articulate its objectives, logic, and decision-making processes in a comprehensible manner. This facet of AI is instrumental in fostering trust among human users. 

This research aims to propel the field of XAI forward by developing practical tools and generating insights for creating interpretable deep learning models. Additionally, the project is dedicated to advocating for responsible and transparent AI practices. The overarching goal is to empower not only the research community but also wider audiences by enhancing their comprehension of AI and bolstering its reliability.

The code developed for the XAI project is organized into two primary sections, Initial Processing and Graphical User Interface.
